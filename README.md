# MaschineChordSetTool
A simple helper tool to show what the Maschine Mikro pads correspond to in Chord Mode (makes up for not having the display of the Mk3).

When using the Mikro it's a pain that we can't see what chords belong in each of the Chord Sets... so I've made a simple helper utility to show all the chords for any given Chord Set and Key.

Raw python code is here for your amusement.  Also, two exectutable versions, a .exe file for Windows users and a standalone package for Mac (it shold be as simple as download MaschineChordSetsForMac.zip, unzip and behold a standalone app that you can drag into Applications).
